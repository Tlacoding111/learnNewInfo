    Types of Events

        1. User Event
            An example is a mouse click
                When a mouse click happens on the button, the callback is triggered and then an alert is shown
        
        2. System Event
            An example is the setTimeout function 
                A callback gets executed after a given time
                    The developer may define the time when the call back gets executed, but the system is what triggers it
            setTimeout (() => {
                alert("Timer finished!");
            }, 10000);
